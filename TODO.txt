Rename 'output' to resolve

Make screen quad frag shaders a util base class that uses a static geom

put all buffers as direct accessors on renderParams rather than accessing through renderTarget

Consider putting depth into normal A channel - to reduce texture lookups

Experiment with different pixel formats on same framebuffer
